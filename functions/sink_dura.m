function [DUR,ONSET,OFFSET,RMS,SINGLE_RMS,PAMP,SINGLE_SinkPeak,PLAT,SINGLE_PeakLat] = ...
    sink_dura(L,sngtrlCSD,BL)
% This function produces the duration of sinks within pre-specified
% layers (from group scripts eg. KIT.m).

% Step 1: a global baseline from all channels and all CSDs in this
% measurement (as in, the CSD for 1 kHz, 2kHz, ... etc) is created and from
% this, BL mean and std are taken.

% Step 2: we loop through the cortical layers to find the raw CSD for that
% layer and stimulus. We also get the raw single CSD [20 chan:800 ms:50
% trial]. Finally we zero source and gaussian smooth the current CSD as a
% seperate variable, AvgCSD_layer.

% Step 3: from the BL mean&std we generate 2 thresholds. The find threshold
% first creates a list of where the CSD intercepts it. The contain
% threshold determines that the CSD then also crosses this second
% threshold. If that condition is met, sink onset is taken as the find
% threshold intercept point. Adjust std_find to change specific onset and
% offset time sensitivity. Adjust std_contain to change detection 
% sensitivity.

% Step 4: we find all sink onsets and offsets in the current layer using
% the AvgCSD_layer, which is cleaner. We then use those onsets and offsets
% on the raw data to get peak amplitude, peak latency, and root mean square
% for the average and single-trial CSDs. These are handed out of the
% function as seperate structures and later folded into the animal's Data
% struct. 

% The output will be sized equally per animal - NaNs will fill in any space
% where there are no sinks detected.

% Note: this code detects *all* possible sinks, the sink onset time will be
% used in further analysis steps to determine which sinks count, for example
% towards tuning or after stim onset time.
